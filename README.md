#### 1. Make sure you do have Docker installed.
Run the check.bat and check the output.
If the output shows information about your Docker installation you should be fine.
If it shows that the command "docker" isn't found download Docker here:
https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/
#### 2. Run Selenoid
If you're not sure if you want to use the VNC feature or not I advice you to run the install-vnc.bat. If you do want it disabled run the install.bat
#### 3. Use it
Just use the url `http://localhost:4444/wd/hub/`
